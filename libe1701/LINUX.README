This folder contains shared libraries (DLL) and link files (LIB)
for Windows only.
For software development using Linux no separate link files are
required, here it is possible to use the normal .SO-files
directly.
So for Linux development, download a suitable software package
from https://halaser.systems/download.php and link against the
contained runtime-so-files (suitable Makefiles can be found in
source examples).
